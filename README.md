No cheating.

# Prompt
I hope that you have fun completing this homework assignment. You are to develop an app that
will download an MP3 from a website (provided by me) and be able to play said MP3. You can
also use another hosted (not saved locally on the device) MP3 of your choosing but be mindful
of copyright laws when doing so. If you opt to use your own hosted MP3, ensure you have
access to the album art or similar art resource to be used with your project. Ensure you bring
your final application together with a clean and attractive UI.
